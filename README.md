getting_and_cleaning_data
=========================

## This repo contains two files:
### run_analysis.R
* Downloads the original data in zip format, transforms the data into a tidy data set, and then writes that data set to a file in the current working directory.
* The resulting file is in csv format, but because the coursera site requires a txt file extension, that is what the file is saved as.

###Codebook.md
* Describes the tidy data set that is produced from running the run_analysis.R script.
